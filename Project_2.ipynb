The first step involved correcting illogical values. Specifically, negative values in the close price column were converted to their absolute values, as negative stock prices do not exist in real-world financial data. This ensured that all close prices reflected valid, positive values.\n","\n","Next, numerical features — close and volume — were scaled using StandardScaler, which standardized these columns so that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This transformation was applied to ensure that both features contribute proportionally to machine learning models, particularly those sensitive to feature scale, such as regression and distance-based algorithms.\n","\n","Categorical data in the sector column was converted into numeric format using one-hot encoding. This approach created new binary columns representing each sector without imposing any ordinal relationship between categories. This method was chosen to ensure that machine learning models could interpret sector information appropriately without introducing bias.\n","\n","The dataset was then split into training, validation, and test sets. First, 80% of the data was reserved for training and validation, while 20% was held out for final testing. The training and validation set was further split, with 75% allocated for training and 25% for validation. This resulted in a final distribution of 60% training data, 20% validation data, and 20% test data. The rationale behind this split was to provide sufficient data for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and unbiased performance evaluation on unseen data.\n","\n","To validate and document the transformations, the distributions of close and volume were inspected before and after scaling. The transformed features were confirmed to have a mean near zero and a standard deviation close to one, as expected with standard scaling. Additionally, histograms were plotted to visually confirm the changes in distribution.\n","\n","Finally, the cleaned and transformed dataset was saved as cleaned_data.csv. The feature and target splits for training, validation, and testing were saved as separate CSV files for future use: x_train.csv, x_val.csv, x_test.csv, y_train.csv, y_val.csv, and y_test.csv. A text-based report summarizing the cleaning and preparation process was also saved to ensure reproducibility and transparency of the workflow.\n","\n","This comprehensive data preparation ensures the dataset is ready for robust and reliable predictive modeling."],"metadata":{"id":"FSgRhatbHbcw"}}]}
